This is an application written in Go which is a proposed replacement for [Pygmy](https://pygmy.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
currently written in Ruby. The goal is to provide a better cross-platform experience
for various users running Lagoon, as well as much greater control over configuration
options via YAML.

Please see the existing [Pygmy documentation](https://pygmy.readthedocs.io) for more information
about Pygmy as this is designed to be a drop-in replacement.

## Early testing

We welcome testers of this tool. You will probably be an existing user of Pygmy who
can verify the same functionality, or perhaps who has had trouble installing Pygmy in the
past on Windows.

## Is Pygmy running?

These instructions will currently install the new version as `pygmy-go` so that the
old version is still available if you have installed it. With no Pygmy running,
you should get "connection refused" when attempting to connect to the local amazee network.

```
curl --HEAD http://myproject.docker.amazee.io
curl: (7) Failed to connect to myproject.docker.amazee.io port 80: Connection refused
```

## Installation

These instructions will build Linux, MacOS and Windows binaries of Pygmy on MacOS,
and then test the MacOS version. Apple M1 is not officially supported. Upstream
docker images provided by Amazee are not yet provided. We'll not deviate from these
images as it would deviate from what is officially supported. You can however provide
configuration to switch out the `haproxy` image for a compatible one if you'd like.

### Compile from source

**Works for**: Linux, MacOS & Windows

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pygmystack/pygmy.git && cd pygmy-go;
make build;
cp ./builds/pygmy-go-darwin /usr/local/bin/pygmy-go;
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pygmy-go;
```

Pygmy is now an executable as `pygmy-go`, while any existing Pygmy is still executable
as `pygmy`. Now start Pygmy and use the new `status` command.

### Using Homebrew

**Works for**: Linux & MacOS

```shell
brew tap pygmystack/pygmy;
brew install pygmy;
```

### Using the AUR

**Works for**: [Arch-based Linux Distributions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch-based_distributions) (Manjaro, Elementary, ArcoLinux etc)

[pygmy-go](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pygmy-go/) and [pygmy-go-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pygmy-go-git/)
are available via the Arch User Repository for Arch-based Linux distributions on the community stream. Unfortunately, 
Pygmy is not yet available via other distribution methods, so it is otherwise recommended to use homebrew or compile 
from source.  

```shell
# Install the latest release:
yay -S pygmy-go;
# Download and compile the latest HEAD from GitHub on the main branch:
yay -S pygmy-go-git;
```

## Usage

If you have an Amazee Lagoon project running, you can test the web address and
expect a `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` response.

```
$ curl --HEAD http://myproject.docker.amazee.io
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: openresty
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: must-revalidate, no-cache, private

Expires: Sun, 19 Nov 1978 05:00:00 GMT

```

If your project is not running you should expect a 503 response:

```
$ curl --HEAD http://FUBARNOTINDAHOUSE.docker.amazee.io
HTTP/1.0 503 Service Unavailable
Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
```

Thanks for testing, please post issues and successes in the queue.

## Local development

To run full regression tests locally, you can follow this process if you have `cmake`, `git` and `go` installed. This 
will prevent a significant amount of build failures and problems after committing.

It will use `dind` and your local daemon to walk through several tests which should pass.

1. First clone the project:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pygmystack/pygmy.git pygmy-go && cd pygmy-go
   ```
2. Perform any updates as required.
3. Clean the environment.
   ```
   go run main.go clean
   ```
4. Build the project.
   ```
   make
   ```
5. Test the project prior to commiting.
   ```
   go test -v
   ```
 
## Releasing
 
We use GitHub Actions for simulating the automated release tagging locally. Using [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act) locally, you can simulate this process and have the same build artifacts in your `dist` folder.
This process will inject the appropriate values into the version logic. To start the process, just run `act`!
