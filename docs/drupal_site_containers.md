#  Drupal Docker Containers


During [Part I](./local_docker_development.md#part-i-shared-docker-containers) we just started the shared Docker containers. For each Drupal Site we need an own Docker Container:

## Prerequisites
  * [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  * On OS X just run `brew install docker-compose`
  * On Linux use your favorite package manager or <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>

##  Find the right `docker-compose.yml`

1. Visit https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-examples or clone https://github.com/lagoon-examples/drupal9-base.git into a folder on your computer
2. Copy the desired example file into your Drupal directory (see descriptions below). Use `example-docker-compose-drupal.yml` if unsure.
3. Rename the file to `docker-compose.yml`
4. Edit the file according to your needs, change at least the host name. _BTW: It's perfectly fine to commit this file into your git repository, so others that are also using docker can use it as well._
5. Run in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml`:

        docker-compose up -d
6. If you are on Windows add the URL to the Hosts file (see [windows documentation](local_docker_development.md) for that).
7. Open your browser with the entered URL in the `docker-compose.yml`, happy Drupaling!

## Connect to the container

To run commands like `git` or other things within the container, you need to connect to the container.

There are two ways for that:

### Connect via `docker-compose` (easier)

This is the easier way, you need to be in the same folder where also the `docker-compose.yml` for that to work:

    docker-compose exec --user drupal drupal bash

### Connect via `docker`

If you want to connect to a container wherever you are right now with your bash:

	docker exec -itu drupal example.com.docker.amazee.io bash

*Replace `example.com.docker.amazee.io` with the docker container you want to connect to*

### Drush from your host machine

To use Drush, you can either connect to the container as above, or add a bash function that will connect for you to run your Drush command. To add the function, add this to your .bashrc file:

Bash:
```
function ddrush() {
  args=""
  while [ "$1" != "" ]; do
    args="${args} '$1'" && shift
  done;

  docker-compose exec --user drupal drupal bash -c "source ~/.bash_envvars && cd \"$AMAZEEIO_WEBROOT\" && PATH=`pwd`/../vendor/bin:\$PATH && drush ${args}"
}
```

Fish Shell - ([fishshell.com](https://fishshell.com/)):
```
function ddrush --description 'Drush fish (friendly interactive shell) function that detects Amazee.io Docker container. '
  if test -f (git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.amazeeio.yml
    echo "Using Amazee.io Docker Container Drush"
    command docker-compose exec --user drupal drupal bash -c "source ~/.bash_envvars && cd \"$AMAZEEIO_WEBROOT\" && PATH=`pwd`/../vendor/bin:\$PATH && drush $argv"
  else
    command drush $argv
  end
end

funcsave drush
```

When you next start a bash session, you'll be able to use `ddrush` just like your normal `drush` command.

## Update Images

We constantly make improvements, updates and some other nice things to our container images. Visit the [Lagoon Image releases page](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-images/releases) to see if there is something new. If you need to update the Docker Images to the newest version from the Docker Hub run in the same folder as the `docker-compose.yml`:

	docker-compose pull
	docker-compose up -d

### Slow Updates?

When pulling a new docker image, the download can get stuck. There is a nice workaround for that: pull a second time :)

Just open another terminal window at the exact same directory than you run the first `docker-compose pull` and just run that command again. The download will be unstuck and continue again. If the download is stuck again, cancel the second command with CTRL+c, and run it again (no worries, the first one will continue to run). Repeat that until the download is completely done.
