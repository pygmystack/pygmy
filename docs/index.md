# Welcome to pygmystack

The pygmy stack is a container stack for local development.

It is a collaboration between:

* [amazee.io](https://www.amazee.io) - Initial development of pygmy, and it's predecessor, [cachalot](https://github.com/amazeeio/cachalot)
* [@fubarhouse](https://github.com/fubarhouse) - complete rewrite of pygmy in Golang (Thanks Karl!)
* [the Lagoon team](https://lagoon.sh) - ongoing support and maintenance

Please see [github.com/pygmystack](https://github.com/pygmystack) for more information

**Why use `pygmy`?**

* Starting the necessary Docker Containers for your Docker Development Environment
The pygmy stack is a container stack for local development, and `pygmy` is the main tool.

It's built to work with:

- [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/)
- [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/)
- [Docker Engine for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)

Quite a lot for such a [small whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmy_sperm_whale) üê≥)

**What `pygmy` will handle for you:**

* Starting the necessary Docker Containers for local development
* If on Linux: Adds `nameserver 127.0.0.1` to your `/etc/resolv.conf` file, so that your local Linux can resolve `*.docker.amazee.io` via the dnsmasq container
* If on Mac with Docker for Mac: Creates the file `/etc/resolver/docker.amazee.io` which tells OS X to forward DNS requests for `*.docker.amazee.io` to the dnsmasq container
* Tries to add the ssh key in `~/.ssh/id_rsa` to the ssh-agent container (no worries if that is the wrong key, you can add more any time)
* Starts a local mail Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) in order to test and view mails
