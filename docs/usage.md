## Start
To start `pygmy` run following command

    pygmy up

`pygmy` will now start all the required Docker containers and add the ssh key.

If you are on Ubuntu you might need to run pygmy with `pygmy up --no-resolver`

**All done?** Head over to [Drupal Docker Containers](./drupal_site_containers.md) to learn how to work with docker containers.

# Command line usage

## Adding ssh keys

Call the `addkey` command with the **absolute** path to the key you would like to add. In case this they is passphrase protected, it will ask for your passphrase.

    pygmy addkey /Users/amazeeio/.ssh/my_other_key

    Enter passphrase for /Users/amazeeio/.ssh/my_other_key:
    Identity added: /Users/amazeeio/.ssh/my_other_key (/Users/amazeeio/.ssh/my_other_key)

## Checking the status

Run `pygmy status` and `pygmy` will tell you how it feels right now and which ssh-keys it currently has in it's stomach:

    pygmy status

    [*] pygmy-ssh-agent: Running as container pygmy-ssh-agent
    [*] mailhog.pygmy.site: Running as container mailhog.pygmy.site
    [*] pygmy-haproxy: Running as container pygmy-haproxy
    [*] pygmy-dnsmasq: Running as container pygmy-dnsmasq
    [*] pygmy-haproxy is connected to network pygmy-network
    [*] Resolv MacOS Resolver is properly connected

## `pygmy down` vs `pygmy clean`

`pygmy` behaves like Docker, it's a whale in the end!

During regular development `pygmy stop` is perfectly fine, it will remove the Docker containers still alive.

If you like to cleanup though, use `pygmy clean` to kill and remove all of the Docker containers, even if they're not alive.

## Access HAProxy statistic page and logs  

HAProxy service has statistics web page already enabled. To access the page, just point the browser to [http://pygmy.site/stats](http://pygmy.site/stats).  

To watch at haproxy container logs, use the `docker logs pygmy-haproxy` command with standard `docker logs` options like `-f` to follow.
